<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a>. I am fortunate to work under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/">Prof. Dan Goldwasser</a>. Broadly speaking, my research interests include Natural Language Understanding and Computational Social Science. Currently, I am working towards building a framework for analyzing polarization in news media. In this work, instead of categorizing the entire news article to a specific ideology, we take a different approach to understand the narrative from a claim's perspective.</p>
	
	<p>Prior to this, I received an M.S degree in <a href="https://www.eecs.psu.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">The Pennsylvania State University</a>, USA in 2021. At Penn State, I worked at the interface between computer science and economics. Specifically, we designed a synthetic prediction market to assess the credibility of published claims in the social and behavioral sciences literature (as part of the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/systematizing-confidence-in-open-research-and-evidence">DARPA SCORE</a> Project).</p> 
	
	<p>Before pursuing graduate studies, I worked as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.wearemiq.com/">MiQ</a>, a digital advertising firm, where I developed solutions to estimate the best match between advertisers and internet users with economic constraints. I received my B.Tech. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://pes.edu/">PES University</a>, India, in 2018.</p>

	<h1>Teaching</h1>
<!-- 	I strongly believe that a good teacher incessantly attempts to step into the shoes of the students. -->
	<p>I strongly beleive that <em>understanding concepts is more important than memorizing concepts</em>. With this as my motivation, I always try my best to propel the students to appreciate the importance and impact of the subject.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Fall 2021:</em> CS 18000 - Problem Solving And Object-Oriented Programming</li>
		<li><em>Spring 2022:</em> CS 18000 - Problem Solving And Object-Oriented Programming</li>
		<li><em>Fall 2022:</em> CS 18000 - Problem Solving And Object-Oriented Programming</li>
	</ul>  
	<p>I am happy to share that I have received <b>Graduate Teaching Award</b> for Fall 2022.</p>
