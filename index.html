<h1>About Me</h1>
	{% include image.html url="https://nnakshat.github.io/images/prof_pic.jpg" width=250 height=400 align="right" %}
	<p>I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a>, specializing in Natural Language Processing. I have the privilege of working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgoldwas/">Prof. Dan Goldwasser</a>. My research interests primarily revolve around the intersection of Natural Language Understanding, and Computational Social Science. I am particularly fascinated by the potential of leveraging computational techniques to gain insights into political discourse and understand how it influences societal dynamics. Currently, my focus lies in developing a framework to analyze and characterize diverse political perspectives found in online news media. The goal is to effectively combat Information Pollution.
	
	<p>Before joining Purdue, I obtained my M.S degree in <a href="https://www.eecs.psu.edu/">Computer Science and Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">The Pennsylvania State University</a>, USA in 2021. During my time at Penn State, I had the opportunity to work at the intersection of computer science and economics. I was the lead graduate student involved in developing a synthetic prediction market that aimed to evaluate the credibility of published claims in the field of social and behavioral sciences literature. This project was an integral part of the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/systematizing-confidence-in-open-research-and-evidence">DARPA SCORE</a> initiative.

	<p>Prior to pursuing graduate studies, I worked as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.wearemiq.com/">MiQ</a>, a digital advertising firm, where I developed solutions to estimate the best match between advertisers and internet users while considering economic constraints. I earned my B.Tech. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://pes.edu/">PES University</a>, India, in 2018.</p>
	
	<p>In my leisure time, I enjoy outdoor activities, particularly hiking and mountain climbing. It gives me a sense of satisfaction and connection with nature. Apart from that, I also play Shuttle Badminton, Squash, and Cricket.</p>

	<h1>Teaching</h1>
	<p>I firmly believe that <em>comprehension of concepts holds greater significance than mere memorization</em>. This conviction motivates me to make dedicated efforts in inspiring students to recognize the importance and real-world impact of the subjects they are studying. I have had the privilege of serving as a graduate teaching assistant for three consecutive semesters: Fall 2021, Spring 2022, and Fall 2022, in the course titled 'CS 18000 - Problem Solving and Object-Oriented Programming'. I am thrilled to share that my dedication and efforts in this course have been recognized, as I have been honored with the prestigious <strong>Graduate Teaching Award</strong>.
